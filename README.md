# 3d-texturing
This is a 3d texturing model which uses blender software for rendering

Since this project requires blender software for rendering, you can download it from 
                https://www.blender.org/download/

A user interface is created where a user can select .obj files and then selecting blender.exe from advanced options in the GUI.

Create an empty folder and then select that empty folder in Render folder options in the GUI.

There are few steps to be followed inorder to render the obj files.

Step 1: Select "Objects" button in the GUI where .obj files are present

Step 2: Select a texture which you want by clicking "Texture file" button in the GUI. (JPEG and PNG format)

Step 4: Select an empty folder where you want to see the output rendered images.

Step 5: In the advanced options, select "Blender executable" button and then select blender.exe.

Now open the empty folder which you created, you can see the output rendered images.



Requirements:
1. Python-3.6  -->  https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. IDE: Your comfort, you can use Pycharm or Spyder or Jupyter Notebook.  (personally I will prefer using Pycharm)



Note: This is tested on win-7 64 bit, with python-3.6.4 installed. 



* Ignore "Map file" button in the GUI, it is still under development.
